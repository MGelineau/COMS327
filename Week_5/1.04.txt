Datastructures:
Suggested approach:
2 Distance maps belong in the world, not in the map.
Hold character in the map not the world
Have data structure that holds npcs (once you find one, print it.  Otherwise print terrain)
Character_t *cmap[][] (Same size as actual map)
    While drawing, if theres is a character there, print it

    Struct character{ hold in map
        char symb;
        pair pos;
        int next_turn;
    }

    priority queue is full of events
        -event queue
            -symbols
            -next_turn (initially 0)
            -seq number

    //Worse approach
    int gt
    for (gt = 0; 1; gt++)
    {
        iterate through characters
        if nt=gt
        movecharacter
    }
